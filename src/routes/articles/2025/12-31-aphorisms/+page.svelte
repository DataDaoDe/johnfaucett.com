    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Aphorisms of 2025</h2>

    <p>Here are some aphorisms that the muses whispered to me this past year.</p>
    <br />

    <AphorismBlock label="1">
        <p>
       	Nothing is more majestic than dreams that can’t come true and nothing more mundane than those that
       	do.
        </p>
    </AphorismBlock>
    <p class="mb-4">
        The dream that will never come true, that can never see the light of a real sun on a day that is perhaps
        a bit too hot, now that is a dream that can stay with you for a lifetime. But alas, the dream realized is foreover gone and in its realization it is whisped away like all the rest each morning when you and I awake.
    </p>

    <AphorismBlock label="2">
        <p>The only man who knows anything is the one who knows he knows absolutely nothing.</p>
    </AphorismBlock>
    <p class="mb-4">Only those who have learned for a lifetime have had the possibility of glancing out at the valley of all that we do not know. And only they have seen that that valley is not a valley at all but as vast and endless as the very fabric of our universe.</p>

<div class="">
    <AphorismBlock label="3">
        <p>The question is the only animal which gives birth to itself.</p>
    </AphorismBlock>
    <p class="mb-4">I was pleasantly suprised to be introduced to a curious creature this year, namely, an interesting fellow, he or she (or perhaps the more appropriately placed they) give birth to themselves, spawning more of their own ilk, much faster than rabbits it seems.</p>

    <AphorismBlock label="4">
        <p>Answers are the gifts that questions give.</p>
    </AphorismBlock>

    <p>Those curiously fascinating self-made creatures can be found hanging around another critter - the answer. These are a various sort, they can be quite long lived, or trite and prone to bite. Any time you want to summon a few, ask people questions about themselves, be forewarned though, this has been known to spawn copious amounts of these little guys.</p>
