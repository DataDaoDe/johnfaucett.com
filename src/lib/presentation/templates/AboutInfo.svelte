		My name is John and I program stuff. In my free time, I build things and study about the world.
		Of course, I fail a lot in my endeavours and make many mistakes, but I guess that's to be
		expected and it does spawn a nice feeling when something works and the world really has been
		improved or your understanding has increased in some significant way.

		I love art, especially books, but mainly just great storytelling and engaging pieces of art. At
		one time in my life I wanted to be an concept artist and had a lot of fun as a would-be
		designer.

	<p>
		I like detailed discussions and getting others exited about all the wonderous world out there
		and all the things there are to explore and learn in it whether its applied mathematics, complex
		systems or painting.
